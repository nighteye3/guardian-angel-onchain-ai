# Architecture \n\n## Overview\nGuardian Angel is a decentralized, AI-driven onchain security agent for BNB Chain. It combines real-time wallet and contract monitoring, AI-based anomaly/threat detection (powered by Groq), and emergency action smart contracts to secure user assets.\n\n## Tech Stack\n- Frontend: React + Vite (in /frontend)\n- Backend: Node.js/Express with Groq integration (in /backend)\n- Smart Contracts: Solidity (in /contracts)\n\n## Core Features\n- Real-time onchain monitoring\n- AI-driven risk analysis (Groq)\n- Automated emergency actions\n- Clear, user-friendly dashboard\n\n## Roadmap\n1. Core scaffolding (this commit)\n2. Core backend (Groq/monitor integration)\n3. Smart contract (action & alert)\n4. Frontend UI\n5. Full system integration & deploy demo\n\n---\n\n_Made for DoraHacks Good Vibes Only: OpenClaw Edition Hackathon by Anukul_
